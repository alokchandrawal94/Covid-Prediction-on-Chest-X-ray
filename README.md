# Covid-Prediction-on-Chest-X-ray

The goal of our project is to build machine learning models that can diagnose whether or not a patient has COVID-19 based on their x-ray. As COVID-19 is a still ongoing global pandemic, related research would contribute much in help doctors with the diagnosis. Our data set consists of the patient’s age, gender, label(positive/negative) of COVID testing result alone with an X-ray image of their chest. The x-ray image of a patient's chest presents a positive correlation with the patient’s diagnosis.
